# PrinTrac.php
## See How Often Users Print Your Webpages
Created By: [Chris Holbrook](http://mad9scientist.com/ "Author's Website")

**Goal:** This php file tracks how often users print your web pages by using a invisible tracking image that is included in your print stylesheet.

**Tested Browsers:** Firefox 10, Safari 5.1, Chrome 17, Opera 11.61, Internet Explorer 8

**Concept and Origin:** This idea is from ShopTalkShow Host Chris Coyier and a user submitted questions (Sorry I don't remember the users name) from Episode 006 with Zoe Gillenwater (http://shoptalkshow.com/episodes/006-with-zoe-gillenwater/ "ShopTalk Show")

**Installation:**

1.	Place printrac.php into your site's image directory or anywhere you want.
2.	Create a directory in the same folder named 'logs'
3.	In your Print CSS file Include the following code:

```
    body:after, .printracphp-ie{
      background:url(path/to/printrac.php/printrac.php?track) no-repeat;
      content: url(path/to/printrac.php/printrac.php?track);
      width: 1px;
      height: 1px;
      display: block;
    }
```

4.	Copy and Paste the below code into the header of your pages, before anything else.

```
<?php
	$printracPage = $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'];
	setcookie('currentpage-printrac-php', $printracPage, 0, "/");
	echo "<div class='printracphp-ie' style='display:none;'></div>";
?>
```
5. That's it!
