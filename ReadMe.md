**Goal:** This php file tracks how often users print your web pages by using a invisible tracking image that is included in your print stylesheet.

**Tested Browsers:** Firefox 10, Safari 5.1, Chrome 17, Opera 11.61, Internet Explorer 8

**Concept and Origin:** This idea is from ShopTalkShow Host Chris Coyier and a user submitted questions (Sorry I don't remember the users name) from [ShopTalk Show - Episode 006 with Zoe Gillenwater](http://shoptalkshow.com/episodes/006-with-zoe-gillenwater/ "ShopTalk Show")

**Installation:**

*	Place printrac.php into your site's image directory or anywhere you want.
*	Create a directory in the same folder named 'logs'
*	In your Print CSS file Include the following code:

```
	body:after, .printracphp-ie{
		background:url(path/to/printrac.php/printrac.php?track) no-repeat;
		content: url(path/to/printrac.php/printrac.php?track);
		width: 1px;
		height: 1px;
		display: block;
	}
```
*	Copy and Paste the below code into the header of your pages, before anything else.

```
<?php
	$printracPage = $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'];
	setcookie('currentpage-printrac-php', $printracPage, 0, "/");
	echo "<div class='printracphp-ie' style='display:none;'></div>";
?>
```
* That's it!
